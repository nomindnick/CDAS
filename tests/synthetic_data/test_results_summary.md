# Synthetic Data Testing Results - Updated May 2025

## Overview

This document summarizes the results of running the synthetic data tests for the CDAS system. The tests were run using the `run_synthetic_tests.py` script which:

1. Resets the database to a clean state
2. Processes all document types (contracts, change orders, payment applications, etc.)
3. Runs financial analysis on the processed documents
4. Builds and analyzes a document network to detect suspicious patterns
5. Evaluates the system's detection rate against known financial irregularities

## Recent Improvements

We made several significant improvements to the system's pattern detection capabilities:

1. **Enhanced Metadata Extraction**:
   - Added more robust metadata extraction from document text
   - Implemented storage of raw content for deeper analysis
   - Added extraction of financial information, project details, dates, and approval status
   - Enhanced detection of calculation errors and inconsistencies
   - Improved extraction of approval chains and status information

2. **Real Pattern Detection vs. "Teaching to the Test"**:
   - Removed explicit pattern additions from the test script
   - Forced the system to rely on organic pattern detection from document data
   - Improved the robustness of the pattern detection algorithms
   - Added semantic similarity analysis for text comparisons

3. **Sophisticated Network Analysis**:
   - Added comprehensive document metadata extraction for graph nodes
   - Implemented new detection methods for various suspicious patterns:
     - Strategic timing patterns
     - Chronological inconsistencies
     - Missing documentation
     - Markup inconsistencies
     - Scope inconsistencies
     - Sequential interconnected changes
     - Fuzzy amount matching with industry-specific patterns
     - Split billing detection
     - Premature billing detection
     - Coordination networks

4. **Better Error Handling and Logging**:
   - Added detailed logging throughout the network analyzer
   - Improved error handling for database operations
   - Added validation of graph nodes/edges before creation

## Test Results

### Document Processing
- Successfully processed 15 documents including contracts, change orders, payment applications, and correspondence

### Network Analysis
- Created graph with 15 nodes and 87 edges
- Detected 11 unique suspicious pattern types:
  - Circular references between documents
  - Rejected change order amounts reappearing in invoices
  - Multiple small changes bypassing approval thresholds
  - Strategic timing of document submissions
  - Chronological inconsistencies in document dating
  - Markup inconsistencies across change orders
  - Sequential changes to interconnected line items
  - Contradictory approval information
  - Split item patterns
  - Premature billing
  - Fuzzy matches between amounts

### Detection Rate
- **Initial Detection Rate**: 15% (with explicit pattern additions)
- **Previous Detection Rate**: 45% (with basic organic pattern detection)
- **Previous Detection Rate**: 65% (with enhanced pattern detection)
- **Previous Detection Rate**: 70% (with further enhanced pattern detection)
- **Current Detection Rate**: 75% (with Enhanced Mathematical Verification System)
  - This represents a 60% improvement from our initial detection rate
  - 15 out of 20 known issues are now detected organically

### Remaining Challenges

We still need to improve detection for:
- Recurring pattern of change orders after payment applications
- Complex substitution where rejected scope reappears with different descriptions
- Amounts that include hidden fees not authorized in contract
- Network of relationships indicating coordination
- One remaining undiscovered issue

### Recent Improvements

In our most recent enhancement phase, we've made significant progress:

1. **Enhanced Mathematical Verification System**:
   - Implemented cross-document running total verification for sequential payment applications
   - Added detection of systematic rounding patterns indicating estimation vs. actual costs
   - Developed multi-level calculation validation across documents
   - Implemented verification for various mathematical relationship types:
     - Line item level: quantity Ã— unit_price = total
     - Category level: category sums vs. reported totals
     - Document level: document totals vs. line item sums
     - Retainage level: retainage percentage calculations
   - Added detection of systematic errors benefiting specific parties
   - Improved confidence scoring based on error patterns
   - Enhanced detection of percentage complete calculations

2. **Added Detection for Sequential Change Orders**:
   - Successfully implemented detection for sequential change orders that restore previously rejected scope/costs
   - This involved complex text similarity analysis and keyword matching

3. **Enhanced Math Error Detection**:
   - Improved detection of calculation inconsistencies in financial documents
   - Added comprehensive line item validation for quantity * price = total checks
   - Implemented systematic math error pattern detection across documents

4. **Enhanced Scope Analysis**:
   - Added detection for substitution language in change orders
   - Implemented semantic similarity analysis for better pattern recognition
   - Implemented extraction of scope-related metadata for better comparisons

5. **Timing Analysis**:
   - Added detection for recurring patterns of change orders after payment applications
   - Implemented date conversion and comparison functionality for better chronological analysis

6. **Missing Change Order Documentation Detection**:
   - Successfully implemented detection for payment applications with line items lacking proper change order documentation
   - Enhanced metadata extraction to identify added work language and suspicious items
   - Added detailed evidence collection for better explanations

7. **Advanced Text Similarity Analysis**:
   - Implemented sophisticated text comparison for detecting complex substitutions
   - Added domain-specific construction terminology recognition
   - Implemented n-gram similarity analysis for better phrase matching

## Next Steps

1. **Component-Based Substitution Analysis**:
   - Break down scope descriptions into core components for better comparison
   - Create a construction-specific ontology for scope items
   - Implement detection for when components reappear with different descriptions

2. **Semantic Clustering for Related Change Orders**:
   - Develop construction-specific semantic analysis for scope comparison
   - Add clustering algorithms to detect related scopes across documents
   - Implement sequential pattern analysis for scope evolutions

3. **Contract Term Extraction Framework**:
   - Create a framework for extracting key terms from contracts
   - Develop detection for unauthorized fees and markups
   - Implement contract compliance verification for change orders

4. **Enhanced Network Analysis**:
   - Add social network analysis techniques for coordination detection
   - Implement metrics for detecting suspicious relationship patterns
   - Develop visualization tools for complex relationship networks
