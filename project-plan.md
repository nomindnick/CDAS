# Construction Document Analysis System
## Project Plan

### Purpose
The Construction Document Analysis System (CDAS) is a specialized tool designed for attorneys representing public agencies (particularly school districts) in construction disputes. Its primary purpose is to process, analyze, and reconcile financial information across various document types to:

1. Track financial claims and counterclaims between parties (district vs. contractor)
2. Identify discrepancies in amounts across different document types
3. Detect suspicious financial patterns (e.g., rejected change orders reappearing in payment applications)
4. Generate comprehensive reports for dispute resolution conferences
5. Provide evidence-backed analysis with direct citations to source documents

The system will empower attorneys to quickly understand the financial landscape of complex construction disputes without manually cross-referencing hundreds of pages of documentation.

### Document Challenges

#### Document Types
The system will process multiple document types, each with unique challenges:

1. **Payment Applications**: 
   - Typically structured forms with line items
   - May include summary and detail pages
   - Often contain handwritten approvals/notes
   - Include both current and cumulative amounts

2. **Change Orders**:
   - Detailed breakdowns of additional work/costs
   - May be approved, rejected, or pending
   - Often include itemized labor, materials, and markup
   - May reference contract clauses or justifications

3. **Spreadsheets**:
   - Complex structures with merged cells
   - Multi-row/column headers
   - Embedded calculations
   - May contain handwritten annotations or highlighting
   - Often created by different parties with inconsistent formats

4. **Project Schedules**:
   - Critical path analysis
   - Timeline impacts
   - Date-based information that ties to delay claims

5. **Correspondence**:
   - Letters and emails about disputed items
   - Narrative context for financial disputes
   - Often references specific amounts without detailed breakdowns

#### Content Challenges

1. **Handwritten Notes**:
   - Variable quality and legibility
   - Critical information often appears as annotations
   - May contradict typed content in the same document

2. **Inconsistent Terminology**:
   - Different parties may use different terms for the same items
   - Line item descriptions may vary between documents
   - Cost codes may be applied inconsistently

3. **Hidden Patterns**:
   - Amounts rejected in one document may reappear elsewhere
   - Markup percentages may be applied inconsistently
   - Same work may be claimed multiple times under different descriptions

4. **Multi-page Context**:
   - Information may be spread across multiple pages/documents
   - Understanding requires cross-referencing various sources
   - Chronological sequence matters for understanding disputes

### Implementation Plan

#### 1. Document Processing Pipeline
- Create specialized extractors for each document type
- Implement OCR for scanned documents

- Preserve document metadata and source information

#### 2. Structured Database
- Design schema optimized for financial forensics
- Implement robust document and line item tracking
- Create entity relationships between documents

- Support both structured and unstructured data

#### 3. Financial Analysis Engine
- Develop pattern matching algorithms
- Implement fuzzy matching for similar amounts
- Create chronological analysis capabilities
- Build anomaly detection for suspicious financial patterns
- Enable transaction reconciliation across documents

#### 4. AI Integration
- Leverage LLMs for document understanding
- Implement semantic search capabilities
- Create agentic analysis workflows
- Enable natural language querying
- Generate narrative explanations of findings

#### 5. Reporting System
- Create flexible report templates
- Implement citation and evidence linking
- Enable interactive exploration of findings
- Support multiple output formats (PDF, HTML, Excel)
- Maintain audit trails for all conclusions

#### 6. Command Line Interface
- Design intuitive commands for all functions
- Implement progress indicators for long-running tasks
- Create interactive query capabilities
- Support batch processing of document sets
- Enable configuration via config files

### Technical Architecture

The system will be built as a Python application with a modular architecture:
